# fluent-plugin-viaq_docker_audit_log_parser
Fluentd parser plugin written specifically for [project-atomic docker audit log](https://github.com/projectatomic/docker/blob/docker-1.12.6/api/server/middleware/audit_linux.go) component, because at the time of writing, there were several [issues](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1496176) with the log format. Once those issues are resolved, this plugin will be deprecated and a generic parser will be uset, whic will allow for generic auditd log consumption.
